                This morning an attacker gained access to the hosting account and files/data for Deer Tier (and my other websites).
                I don't know what data, if any, they actually collected, but they had the means to access the DT database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attacker would've been able to retrieve usernames, salted and hashed passwords, and IP addresses for DT users.
                DT user accounts are not associated with email addresses, which is helpful for security in this situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recommend logging in to DT and changing your password by clicking the link with your username at the top right.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm working with the support team at my host to investigate how the attacker gained access so I can patch any security holes.
                At the moment I've reset all passwords on the hosting side (not user accounts) and verified the DT database is intact.
                I sincerely apologize for this breach.

                Deer Tier has been migrated to a new host and the database has been restored from a backup taken on April 9, 2019. This is the most recent backup that I had, unfortunately.
                Records submitted between April 9 - 23 will need to be resubmitted. Any accounts created during this time will also need to be recreated.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you missed the outage, Deer Tier was down from April 23 to May 3 due to a "service interruption" on our old host (you can read about it <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/01/a2_hosting_down/" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested). The web server was restored after a few days
                but as of right now the database still hasn't been restored. I didn't want to keep Deer Tier offline any longer so I've given up and moved to a new host.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm very sorry about the lengthy outage and the lost data. I'll be setting up a better backup process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from the lost data I believe everything should be working. Please let me know if you notice any issues.

                I've set up a GitHub repository for the Deer Tier codebase <a href="https://github.com/tomvoros/deertier" target="_blank">here</a>. The code could still use some improvements
                but it's in decent enough shape for sharing now. Anyone who wants to work on the website can go ahead and submit pull requests but please make sure your changes
                have been approved by the community first. It's probably a good idea to discuss the changes on Discord.

                Hello, I'm MrLandmaster's brother! He doesn't have as much time to work on Deer Tier these days so I'll be taking over most of the development work.
                We started by implementing a new two-level category structure, along with some improvements to the data schema behind the scenes.
                If you find any bugs please send them to support (at) deertier (dot) com. More improvements coming down the line!
